(Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes.

   abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

   abstract = {This book provides a solid statistical foundation for neural networks from a pattern recognition perspective. The focus is on the types of neural nets that are most widely used in practical applications, such as the multi-layer perceptron and radial basis function networks. Rather than trying to cover many different types of neural networks, Bishop thoroughly covers topics such as density estimation, error functions, parameter optimization algorithms, data pre-processing, and Bayesian methods. All topics are organized well and all mathematical foundations are explained before being applied to neural networks. The text is suitable for a graduate or advanced undergraduate level course on neural networks or for practitioners interested in applying neural networks to real-world problems. The reader is assumed to have the level of math knowledge necessary for an undergraduate science degree. This is the first comprehensive treatment of feed-forward neural networks from the perspective of statistical pattern recognition. After introducing the basic concepts, the book examines techniques for modelling probability density functions and the properties and merits of the multi-layer perceptron and radial basis function network models. Also covered are various forms of error functions, principal algorithms for error function minimalization, learning and generalization in neural networks, and Bayesian techniques and their applications. Designed as a text, with over 100 exercises, this fully up-to-date work will benefit anyone involved in the fields of neural computation and pattern recognition.},

   abstract = {The increasing world population and availability of energy hungry smart devices are major reasons for alarmingly high electricity consumption in the current times. So far, various simulation tools, engineering and Artificial Intelligence based methods are being used to perform optimal electricity demand forecasting. While engineering methods use dynamic equations to forecast, the AI-based methods use historical data to predict future demand. However, modeling of nonlinear electricity demand patterns is still underdeveloped for robust solutions as the existing methods are useful only for handling short-term dependencies. Moreover, the existing methods are static in nature because they are purely historical data driven. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based framework to forecast electricity demand by taking care of long-term historical dependencies. Initially, the cluster analysis is performed on the electricity consumption data of all months to generate season based segmented data. Subsequently, load trend characterization is carried out to have a deeper insight of metadata falling into each of the clusters. Further, Long Short Term Memory network multi-input multi-output models are trained to forecast electricity demand based upon the season, day and interval data. In the present work, we have also incorporated the concept of moving window based active learning to improve prediction results. To demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is applied to the electricity consumption data of Union Territory Chandigarh, India. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by comparing the prediction results with Artificial Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network and Support Vector Regression models.},

   abstract = {Forecasting electricity demand through time series is a tool used by transmission system operators to establish future operating conditions. The accuracy of these forecasts is essential for the precise development of activity. However, the accuracy of the forecasts is enormously subject to the calendar effect. The multiple seasonal Holt-Winters models are widely used due to the great precision and simplicity that they offer. Usually, these models relate this calendar effect to external variables that contribute to modification of their forecasts a posteriori. In this work, a new point of view is presented, where the calendar effect constitutes a built-in part of the Holt-Winters model. In particular, the proposed model incorporates discrete-interval moving seasonalities. Moreover, a clear example of the application of this methodology to situations that are difficult to treat, such as the days of Easter, is presented. The results show that the proposed model performs well, outperforming the regular Holt-Winters model and other methods such as artificial neural networks and Exponential Smoothing State Space Model with Box-Cox Transformation, ARMA Errors, Trend and Seasonal Components (TBATS) methods.},

In this paper, a five layer CNN-LSTM model is proposed for photovoltaic power predictions using real data from a location in Temixco, Morelos in Mexico. In the proposed hybrid model, the convolutional layer acts like a filter, extracting local features of the data; then the temporal features are extracted by the long short-term memory network. Finally, the performance of the hybrid model with five layers is compared with a single model (a single LSTM), a CNN-LSTM hybrid model with two layers and two well known popular benchmarks. The results also shows that the hybrid neural network model has better prediction effect than the two layer hybrid model, the single prediction model, the Lasso regression or the Ridge regression.},

   abstract = {This paper introduces a novel algorithm for big data time series forecasting. Its main novelty lies in its ability to deal with multivariate data, i.e. to consider multiple time series simultaneously, in order to make multi-output predictions. Real-world processes are typically characterised by several interrelated variables, and the future occurrence of certain time series cannot be explained without understanding the influence that other time series might have on the target time series. One key issue in the context of the multivariate analysis is to determine a priori whether exogenous variables must be included in the model or not. To deal with this, a correlation analysis is used to find a minimum correlation threshold that an exogenous time series must exhibit, in order to be beneficial. Furthermore, the proposed approach has been specifically designed to be used in the context of big data, thus making it possible to efficiently process very large time series. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach we use data from Spanish electricity prices. Results have been compared to other multivariate approaches showing remarkable improvements both in terms of accuracy and execution time.},

   abstract = {It is a well-known fact that improving forecasting accuracy is an important yet often challenging issue. Extensive research has been conducted using neural networks (NNs) to improve their forecasting accuracy. In general, the inputs to NNs are the auto-regressive (i.e. lagged variables) of one or more time series. In addition, either network outputs or network errors have been used as extra inputs to NNs. In this paper, however, we propose a novel recurrent neural network forecasting model which is called the ridge polynomial neural network with error-output feedbacks (RPNN-EOF). RPNN-EOF has two main types of inputs: auto-regressive and moving-average inputs. The former is represented by the lagged variables of a time series, while the latter is represented by feeding back network error to the input layer. In addition, network output is fed back to the input layer. The proposed recurrent model has the ability to produce more accurate forecasts due to the advantages of learning temporal dependence and the direct modelling of the moving-average component. A comparative analysis of RPNN-EOF with five neural network models was completed using ten time series. Simulation results have shown that RPNN-EOF is the most accurate model among all the compared models with the time series used. This shows that employing auto-regressive and moving-average inputs together helps to produce more accurate forecasts.},

The energy storage may allow flexible generation and delivery of stable electricity for meeting demands of customers. The requirements for energy storage will become triple of the present values by 2030 for which very special devices and systems are required. The objective of the current review research is to compare and evaluate the devices and systems presently in use and anticipated for the future.

   abstract = {A validation dataset is a sample of data held back from training your model that is used to give an estimate of model skill while tuning modelâs hyperparameters. The validation dataset is different from the test dataset that is also held back from the training of the model, but is instead used to give an unbiased estimate of the skill of the final tuned model when comparing or selecting between final models. There is much confusion in applied machine learning about what a validation dataset is exactly and how it differs from a test dataset. In this post, you will discover clear definitions for train, test, and validation datasets and how to use each in your own machine learning projects.},

   abstract = {In the hydrological cycle, rainfall is a major component and plays a vital role in planning and managing water resources. In this study, new generation deep learning models, recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), were applied for forecasting monthly rainfall, using long sequential raw data for time series analysis. âAll-Indiaâ monthly average precipitation data for the period 1871â2016 were taken to build the models and they were tested on different homogeneous regions of India to check their robustness. From the results, it is evident that both the trained models (RNN and LSTM) performed well for different homogeneous regions of India based on the raw data. The study shows that a deep learning network can be applied successfully for time series analysis in the field of hydrology and allied fields to mitigate the risks of climatic extremes.},

   abstract = {Accurate prediction of data center resource utilization is required for capacity planning, job scheduling, energy saving, workload placement, and load balancing to utilize the resources efficiently. However, accurately predicting those resources is challenging due to dynamic workloads, heterogeneous infrastructures, and multi-tenant co-hosted applications. Existing prediction methods use fixed size observation windows which cannot produce accurate results because of not being adaptively adjusted to capture local trends in the most recent data. Therefore, those methods train on large fixed sliding windows using an irrelevant large number of observations yielding to inaccurate estimations or fall for inaccuracy due to degradation of estimations with short windows on quick changing trends. In this paper we propose a deep learning-based adaptive window size selection method, dynamically limiting the sliding window size to capture the trend for the latest resource utilization, then build an estimation model for each trend period. We evaluate the proposed method against multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods, using real data-center workload data sets. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed solution outperforms those state-of-the-art approaches and yields 16 to 54% improved prediction accuracy compared to the baseline methods.},

   abstract = {Recurrent nets are in principle capable to store past inputs to produce the currently desired output. Because of this property recurrent nets are used in time series prediction and process control. Practical applications involve temporal dependencies spanning many time steps, e.g. between relevant inputs and desired outputs. In this case, however, gradient based learning methods take too much time. The extremely increased learning time arises because the error vanishes as it gets propagated back. In this article the decaying error flow is theoretically analyzed. Then methods trying to overcome vanishing gradients are briefly discussed. Finally, experiments comparing conventional algorithms and alternative methods are presented. With advanced methods long time lag problems can be solved in reasonable time.},

   abstract = {Energy consumption has been widely studied in the computer architecture field for decades. While the adoption of energy as a metric in machine learning is emerging, the majority of research is still primarily focused on obtaining high levels of accuracy without any computational constraint. We believe that one of the reasons for this lack of interest is due to their lack of familiarity with approaches to evaluate energy consumption. To address this challenge, we present a review of the different approaches to estimate energy consumption in general and machine learning applications in particular. Our goal is to provide useful guidelines to the machine learning community giving them the fundamental knowledge to use and build specific energy estimation methods for machine learning algorithms. We also present the latest software tools that give energy estimation values, together with two use cases that enhance the study of energy consumption in machine learning.},

   abstract = {The increasing number of decentralized renewable energy sources together with the grow in overall electricity consumption introduce many new challenges related to dimensioning of grid assets and supply-demand balancing. Approximately 40% of the total energy consumption is used to cover the needs of commercial and office buildings. To improve the design of the energy infrastructure and the efficient deployment of resources, new paradigms have to be thought up. Such new paradigms need automated methods to dynamically predict the energy consumption in buildings. At the same time these methods should be easily expandable to higher levels of aggregation such as neighborhoods and the power grid. Predicting energy consumption for a building is complex due to many influencing factors, such as weather conditions, performance and settings of heating and cooling systems, and the number of people present. In this paper, we investigate a newly developed stochastic model for time series prediction of energy consumption, namely the Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CRBM), and evaluate its performance in the context of building automation systems. The assessment is made on a real dataset consisting of 7 weeks of hourly resolution electricity consumption collected from a Dutch office building. The results showed that for the energy prediction problem solved here, CRBM outperforms Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).},
